# godot-script-library
a godot script library for my projects your welcomed to use it 100% MIT licenced

this  library of Godot scripts will grow over time this is for myself as well as for you to use freely share and distribute if you want, I will ask that you refrain form selling it though

I am currently working on making a script or possibly a library of scripts dedicated to making a thread pool function for Godot with debug code ,log code and notes

I am planning on making it a plugin for Godot with GDnative at some point
but I'm starting in GDscripts as it's the easiest and require no setup (except for downloading Godot)

also if you have suggestions or possible fixes to bugs don't hesitate to contact me via the comments I'll do my best to answer them all
